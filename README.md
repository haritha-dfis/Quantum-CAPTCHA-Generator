# Quantum-CAPTCHA-Generator

🧠 Educational Simulation of Quantum-Inspired CAPTCHA Security
This project demonstrates how quantum principles can be applied to secure CAPTCHA generation.
It provides an interactive Python tool that generates dynamic, visually distorted CAPTCHAs using quantum-inspired randomness and cryptographic techniques.
The tool helps users understand how quantum randomness and visual noise enhance security against automated attacks.

🚀 Features
🔐 Quantum Random Text — Generates unpredictable strings using simulated quantum superposition or cryptographic randomness.
🎨 Visual Distortion — Applies rotations, random line noise, and Gaussian blur to the CAPTCHA.
🖌️ Dynamic Coloring — Randomized background and text colors for each CAPTCHA.
🖼️ Automatic Image Saving — Each CAPTCHA is saved with a unique filename to avoid collisions.
👁️ Interactive Display — Automatically shows CAPTCHA images for user verification.

🧩 Project Overview
This project bridges Quantum Computing concepts and web security, simulating how quantum randomness can:
Make CAPTCHA text unpredictable and unique each time,
Increase resistance to bots and OCR attacks,
Allow dynamic visual distortion for added security,
Demonstrate the role of quantum principles in cryptographically secure systems.
